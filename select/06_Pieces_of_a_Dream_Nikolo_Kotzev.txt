In the forest and in the town
In the fields, where my people gather round
Happiness, I am for real
And I know I belong
And I can't be wrong
Cause I've been giving you, giving you
I've been giving you my word

Can you hear the motherland
The motherland worships me?
And it don't seem like I'm growing old, oh no
And I'm giving you, the pieces of a dream
Do you know how I feel?
And do you know what it means?

I will walk through the mountain
And I will walk through the night (Through the night)
I will stand in the fountain
Of goodness and burning white light (Burning light)
I don't live in shame
I'm so glad you came
I ask the question to my God
I wear the golden ring
And I won't change a thing
Inside the presence of the light
I am living, just for you

In the forest and in the town
In the fields, where my people gather round
Happiness, I am for real
And I know I belong
And I can't be wrong
Cause I've been giving you, giving you
I've been giving you my word

Can you hear the motherland
The motherland worships me?
And it don't seem like I'm growing old
And I've been giving you, the pieces of a dream
Do you know how I feel?
And do you know what it means?

I will walk through the mountain
And I will walk through the night (Through the night)
I will stand in the fountain
Of goodness and burning white light (Burning light)
I don't live in shame
I'm so glad you came
I ask the question to my God
I wear the golden ring
And I won't change a thing
Inside the presence of the light
I am living, just for you

I am living just for you, you, you

(We are living just for you)
(The king endures everything)
(And the Devil carries the day away
(Evil Devil carries the day away)

In the forest and in the town
In the fields, where my people gather round
Happiness, I am for real
And I know I belong
And I can't be wrong
Cause I've been giving you, giving you
I've been giving you my word
Oh, yeah, oh yes I'm
I am, oh yes I am,
I'm giving you, giving you
Oh, the pieces of a dream
